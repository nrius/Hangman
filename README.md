# Nuria's hangman game



This is my first project, after 4 days at Ironhack!



# Instructions

1. This is a game where **human** plays againts **cpu**:
2. **cpu** will chose a random *word* from a list of words related to *python*
3. **cpu** will ask **human** for input letters (the human *guess*)
4. Every *guess* is checked in the *word* to guess
5. If the *guess* is present in the *word* **cpu** will tell human how many times 
6. **cpu** will also display a plot placing the right guess and the previous ones
8. **human** can enter 7 wrong *guesses* before being hanged
9. If **human** guesses all the letters before exhausting the opportunities, **human** wins
10. Otherwise, **human** loses and dies

Pretty weird system of appeals, right?
